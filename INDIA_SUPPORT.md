## Why Indian Cities Matter

### Realistic AQI Values
Indian cities typically have:
- **Higher AQI** (150-250 range) vs global cities (80-180)
- **Higher PM2.5** (40-120 µg/m³) due to:
  - Vehicle emissions
  - Construction dust
  - Industrial pollution
  - Seasonal factors (stubble burning, Diwali)
- **Temperature**: 28-40°C (realistic for Indian climate)
- **Humidity**: 50-90% (monsoon-influenced)

### Location-Aware Analysis
The app recognizes Indian cities and provides:
- 🇮🇳 India flag indicator
- More accurate pollution ranges
- Climate-appropriate recommendations
- Context-aware health advice

## Example Use Cases

### 🏠 **Apartment in Mumbai**
```
Location: Mumbai
Expected AQI: 180-220
Issues: High PM2.5 from traffic, humidity from sea
Recommendations: Use air purifier, avoid peak traffic hours
```

### 🏢 **Office in Hyderabad**
```
Location: Hyderabad
Expected AQI: 120-160
Issues: Construction dust, AC dependency
Recommendations: HEPA filters, regular ventilation
```

### 🎓 **Student Room in Visakhapatnam**
```
Location: Visakhapatnam
Expected AQI: 100-140
Issues: Coastal humidity, industrial area proximity
Recommendations: Dehumidifier, air circulation
```

### 🏘️ **Home in Delhi NCR**
```
Location: Delhi
Expected AQI: 250-300 (winter), 150-200 (summer)
Issues: Severe PM2.5, seasonal pollution
Recommendations: N95 masks outdoors, sealed windows during peak pollution
```

## Understanding Your Results

### AQI Ranges (India-Specific)
- **0-50**: Good (Rare in metro cities)
- **51-100**: Satisfactory (Occasional in coastal cities)
- **101-200**: Moderate (Common year-round)
- **201-300**: Poor (Delhi winters, Diwali period)
- **301-400**: Very Poor (Severe pollution episodes)
- **401-500**: Severe (Emergency conditions)

### What the AI Checks in Your Video

#### Indoor Issues (Common in Indian Homes)
- **Ventilation**: Windows closed due to outdoor pollution
- **AC Units**: Overuse without fresh air intake
- **Kitchen Smoke**: Cooking without exhaust (masala, frying)
- **Incense/Agarbatti**: Daily puja smoke accumulation
- **Dust**: Construction activity, unpaved roads nearby
- **Humidity**: Monsoon dampness, mold growth

#### Outdoor Context (Indian Cities)
- High vehicular pollution
- Construction dust
- Industrial emissions
- Seasonal crop burning (North India)
- Festival fireworks (Diwali)
- Summer heat and dust storms

## Tips for Indian Users

### Best Times to Check AQI
- **Morning**: 6-8 AM (before traffic peaks)
- **Evening**: 6-9 PM (high pollution hours)
- **Post-Rain**: Usually improved AQI
- **Winter Mornings**: Worst AQI in North India

### Seasonal Considerations
- **Summer** (Mar-Jun): Dust storms, high temperature
- **Monsoon** (Jul-Sep): High humidity, mold risk
- **Post-Monsoon** (Oct-Nov): Stubble burning, Diwali
- **Winter** (Dec-Feb): Severe AQI in North, fog traps pollutants

### Room Improvements for Indian Climate
1. **Use HEPA Air Purifiers** (PM2.5 removal)
2. **Cross-Ventilation** (early morning when AQI is better)
3. **Indoor Plants** (Money plant, Areca palm, Snake plant)
4. **Kitchen Exhaust** (mandatory for Indian cooking)
5. **Dehumidifiers** (coastal/monsoon regions)
6. **Door Seals** (prevent outdoor pollution entry)
